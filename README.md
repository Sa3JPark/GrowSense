# 🌱 GrowSense  

**A smartphone-based plant light monitoring app that infers ambient light levels using camera sensor data, leveraging ISO sensitivity and exposure duration instead of relying solely on the ambient light sensor (ALS).**  

This approach improves accuracy across different devices and lighting conditions, ensuring optimal plant growth.

## 🌟 Key Features  

✅ **Camera-Based Light Estimation** – Uses ISO and exposure duration to infer ambient light.  

✅ **Guided Calibration Mode** – Multi-angle readings for enhanced precision.  

✅ **Data Logging & Analysis** – Tracks light intensity and duration over time.  

✅ **Plant-Specific Insights** – Provides tailored lighting recommendations for optimal growth.  

✅ **Weekly Plant Care Reminders** – Custom schedules for watering, light exposure, and maintenance.  

By combining **sensor fusion techniques** with **image-based exposure analysis**, GrowSense provides a **more reliable and accessible** plant light monitoring tool.  

🌿 **Optimizing plant growth with smarter light sensing!**
