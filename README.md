# GrowSense
A smartphone-based plant light monitoring app that infers ambient light levels using camera sensor data, leveraging ISO sensitivity and exposure duration instead of relying solely on the ambient light sensor (ALS). This approach improves accuracy across different devices and lighting conditions.

Key Features:
âœ… Camera-Based Light Estimation â€“ Uses ISO and exposure duration to infer ambient light.
âœ… Guided Calibration Mode â€“ Multi-angle readings for enhanced precision.
âœ… Data Logging & Analysis â€“ Tracks light intensity and duration over time.
âœ… Plant-Specific Insights â€“ Provides tailored lighting recommendations for optimal growth.
âœ… Weekly Plant Care Reminders â€“ Custom schedules for watering, light exposure, and maintenance.

By combining sensor fusion techniques with image-based exposure analysis, this project aims to create a more reliable and accessible plant light monitoring tool.

ðŸŒ¿ Optimizing plant growth with smarter light sensing!
